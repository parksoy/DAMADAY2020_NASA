# DAMADAY2020_NASA Temporary repo for preparation
(Pre-event tasks for analysis setup)

# Purpose of this REPO
To track and archive local work

As of Oct 6,2020
Soyoung currently reads first received csv, simple EDA locally.


# TO DO
Will need to 

Jupyter notebook from Victoria.  
requirement.txt from Victoria.  
Tal gives Soyoung a link to csv, a link to data table in Snowflake.  
Soyoung moves the noteboooks to Zepl.  
Soyoung stiches Victoria's in Zepl with various algorithms API pages(super simple examples).  

# Official Due for this pre
Pre-event tasks for analysis setup will be shared on 10/19 via email.

# Main Quesions

Morning session (Eric + Victoria)
* Is there a better process than the unsupervised → supervised we are using?  
* How can we make more data? Transfer learning is still a big question mark, how is it implementable? What is the best way?  
* How do we avoid missing the anomaly that contains the Nobel prize? (--> trusting AI theme)  

Afternoon session (James)
* What methods for decision making process (classical expert system approach, ML approach) understand how the process works, “explainable AI” (--> trusting AI theme)
How do we choose new data to collect with an ETU  (engineering test unit = spare instrument that is on Earth), now we are using one vs rest classification to see what types of classes the models struggle on but maybe there is a better way
